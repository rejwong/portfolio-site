# portfolio-site

The portfolio website will act as a preview of my development work, with projects added when they are finished. This is my first responsive site and includes optimized images, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

## Getting Started

This project also needs grunt-cli to be installed globally and ImageMagick:
>To make it simpler to run (without having to install grunt and imagemagick ) I have included the cut images, normally I would add this into a build task.

- Grunt
  - `npm install grunt -g`
- ImageMagick
  - `brew install ImageMagick` (Mac)
  - [Other ways to install](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
- to cut images: `npm run cut-images`

- Install NPM packages using `npm install`
- To run local server use: `npm start`
- Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser 

## About my code

This project includes the use of: 

- `ExpressJS` to set up the local server.
- `Grunt` and `ImageMagick` to optimize images.
- `Normalize.css` to reset CSS and provide a consistent base for code.

## More information

This project was created as part of my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, which was awarded through a Google Developer Scholarship. Future plans for the project include making the full page a grid, providing links to information about individual projects as a single page app or as part of a multi-page site, and adding personal/skills information. The README will be updated accordingly.
