# portfolio-site

My portfolio site will act as a preview for my front-end development work. It will feature front-end web development projects as they are finished and uploaded, with one main image and additional images with titles. This is my first responsive site, built as the first project on the Google Developer Scholarship - Udacity Front-End nanodegree. The site uses responsive images and CSS Grid.

## Getting Started

Install NPM packages using `npm install`
To run local server use: `npm start`
Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser 

## About my code
For this project I used: 

`Express` to set up the local server.

`Grunt` and `ImageMagick` to optimize images, from the previous exercise.

`Normalize.css` to reset CSS to provide a good consistent base to work off.
